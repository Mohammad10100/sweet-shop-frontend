### 6. ü§ñ My AI Usage

For transparency, here‚Äôs how I used AI tools during development:
ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) and Claude (Sonnet 4)

- Helped brainstorm component structures (e.g., SweetCard, SweetForm, RestockModal).
- Generating Boiler Plate Codes.
- Provided guidance on state management and modal handling.
- Assisted in writing the initial README.md template.
- Suggested better commit messages for clarity.

Reflection
Using AI sped up my workflow significantly, especially since I had only a couple of days to complete the frontend.
However, I made sure to review and edit all generated code before integrating it, ensuring I understood each part.
Without AI, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finish the frontend within the limited time, but I retained full control over the logic and design choices.


### 6. üß™ Testing
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to strict time constraints (personal emergency), I could not implement frontend test cases.
However, the backend tests are available and validated (see [/backend/README.md](https://github.com/Mohammad10100/sweet-shop?tab=readme-ov-file#sweet-shop))
